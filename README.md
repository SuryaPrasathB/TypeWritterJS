# Typing Speed Text

A simple clone version of the popular typing speed testers online.

## Description

This implementation includes the very base ability to get user input and compare with the paragraph provided. It indicated with green and red colors to verify correct or incorrect user input. The base version does not include backspace input support. I have added additional backspace input support to ensure that the user can rewrite the mistakes made in the paragraph.
